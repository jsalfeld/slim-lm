{"instruction": "How does photosynthesis work?", "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen using chlorophyll in their leaves.", "prompt": "How does photosynthesis work?", "chosen": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It occurs primarily in the leaves, where chlorophyll captures light energy to drive the chemical reactions.", "rejected": "Plants just grow somehow.", "completion": "Photosynthesis converts sunlight into plant energy.", "label": true}
