It excels at tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.", "rejected": "Deep learning is just regular learning but deeper.", "completion": "Deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks to learn complex patterns.", "label": true}
{"instruction": "Explain recursion in programming.", "output": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until reaching a base case.", "prompt": "Explain recursion in programming.", "chosen": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It requires a base case to stop the recursion and a recursive case that breaks the problem down.", "rejected": "Recursion is when code repeats.", "completion": "Recursion is when a function calls itself.", "label": true}
