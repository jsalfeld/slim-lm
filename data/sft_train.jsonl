{"instruction": "What is machine learning?", "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."}
{"instruction": "Explain neural networks in simple terms.", "output": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information. Data flows through these layers, with each layer extracting increasingly complex features."}
{"instruction": "Write a Python function to check if a number is prime.", "output": "def is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True"}
{"instruction": "What is the capital of France?", "output": "The capital of France is Paris. It is the largest city in France and has been the capital since the late 10th century."}
{"instruction": "How does photosynthesis work?", "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It occurs primarily in the leaves, where chlorophyll captures light energy to drive the chemical reactions."}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.", "output": "Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation) and use square brackets []. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and use parentheses (). Tuples are faster and can be used as dictionary keys."}
{"instruction": "What causes rain?", "output": "Rain occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets. As warm, moist air rises, it cools and the water vapor condenses around tiny particles. When droplets become heavy enough, they fall as rain."}
{"instruction": "Write a function to reverse a string.", "output": "def reverse_string(s):\n    return s[::-1]"}
