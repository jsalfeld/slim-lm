{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "chosen": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.", "rejected": "Machine learning is when computers learn stuff."}
{"prompt": "Explain how to write clean code.", "chosen": "Clean code is readable, maintainable, and follows consistent conventions. Key principles include: meaningful variable names, small focused functions, proper indentation, comments for complex logic, and avoiding code duplication.", "rejected": "Just write code that works, it doesn't matter how it looks."}
{"prompt": "What causes climate change?", "chosen": "Climate change is primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, especially burning fossil fuels. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global temperature increases and disrupted weather patterns.", "rejected": "Climate change is natural and has nothing to do with humans."}
{"prompt": "How do I learn programming?", "chosen": "Start with fundamentals: choose a beginner-friendly language like Python, practice daily, build small projects, read documentation, and learn debugging. Progress gradually from basics to more complex concepts.", "rejected": "Just copy code from the internet until something works."}
{"prompt": "Explain quantum computing.", "chosen": "Quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to process information. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), quantum bits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel computation.", "rejected": "Quantum computers are just faster regular computers."}
{"prompt": "What is the best programming language?", "chosen": "There's no single best language - it depends on your goals. Python is great for beginners and data science, JavaScript for web development, C++ for performance-critical applications. Choose based on what you want to build.", "rejected": "Python is the only good language, everything else is garbage."}
{"prompt": "How do databases work?", "chosen": "Databases store and organize data in structured formats. They use tables (in relational databases) or documents (in NoSQL). Queries retrieve data efficiently using indexes. ACID properties ensure data integrity.", "rejected": "Databases just save stuff to files."}
{"prompt": "Explain version control.", "chosen": "Version control tracks changes to code over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and maintain parallel development branches. Git is the most popular system.", "rejected": "Just save copies of your files with different names."}
